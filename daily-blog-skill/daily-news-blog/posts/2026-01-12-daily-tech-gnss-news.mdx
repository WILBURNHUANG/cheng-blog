The first full week of 2026 brings major energy and investment shifts in tech, while CES unveils next-generation precision positioning solutions. Meta's multi-gigawatt nuclear commitments signal how seriously big tech is taking AI infrastructure demands, while sovereign wealth funds' record $15 trillion in assets under management—with $15 billion flowing into AI—underscores global recognition of the sector's strategic importance. Meanwhile, the GNSS industry is pushing precision positioning into consumer robotics and strengthening aerial navigation for contested environments.

## Tech News

CES 2026 kicked off the year with bold statements about AI's transformative potential, but the real story lies in the massive infrastructure and capital commitments being made to support it.

### Meta Signs Multi-Gigawatt Nuclear Power Deals for AI Data Centers

Meta Platforms is positioning itself to become one of the world's largest corporate buyers of nuclear power, striking multiple deals that could total more than 6 gigawatts—enough electricity to power approximately 5 million homes. The agreements represent a strategic response to the enormous energy demands of AI training and inference workloads, which are straining traditional power infrastructure.

This move reflects a broader industry trend: as AI models grow exponentially in size and capability, the companies building them are being forced to secure baseload power generation decades in advance. Unlike wind or solar, nuclear provides the consistent, always-on power that massive data centers require. Meta's commitment suggests the company expects AI compute demands to continue accelerating well into the 2030s.

The deals also position Meta favorably against competitors in the AI race. With data center capacity increasingly constrained by power availability rather than capital or talent, securing gigawatt-scale energy sources provides a tangible competitive moat. Energy availability is becoming as strategically important as chip access in determining which companies can train cutting-edge AI systems.

### Sovereign Wealth Funds Push $15 Billion Into Tech as Assets Hit $15 Trillion

Global sovereign wealth funds reached a record $15 trillion in assets under management, with approximately $15 billion deployed into AI-related investments during 2025 alone. This represents a fundamental shift in how nation-states are positioning themselves for the AI era, moving from passive observers to active participants in shaping the technology landscape.

The influx of sovereign capital carries significant implications for the tech ecosystem. Unlike venture capital, which typically seeks 5-10 year exit horizons, sovereign funds can take multi-decade positions aligned with national strategic interests. This patient capital is particularly valuable for capital-intensive AI infrastructure projects and foundational research that may not generate immediate returns.

However, the geopolitical dimensions cannot be ignored. As sovereign funds from the Middle East, Asia, and Europe increase their stakes in Western AI companies, questions about technology transfer, data sovereignty, and national security are intensifying. The $15 billion figure likely understates total sovereign exposure when indirect investments through funds and SPVs are included.

### Mobileye Announces $900 Million Acquisition of Mentee Robotics

Intel-backed autonomous driving company Mobileye revealed plans to acquire Mentee Robotics for $900 million, with the deal expected to close in Q1 2026. Mentee Robotics brings expertise in embodied AI and humanoid robotics, suggesting Mobileye sees opportunities beyond automotive applications for its perception and planning technology.

The acquisition reflects a growing convergence between autonomous vehicles and general-purpose robotics. The computer vision, sensor fusion, and real-time decision-making capabilities developed for self-driving cars translate directly to warehouse automation, service robots, and manufacturing applications. By acquiring Mentee, Mobileye gains access to bipedal locomotion and manipulation capabilities that could diversify its revenue streams as the automotive autonomy timeline extends.

### Tech Stocks Poised for 20-25% Gains in 2026, Says Wedbush

Dan Ives, Managing Director of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities, forecast that tech stocks could climb 20-25% in 2026, calling it "a prove it year" for AI. The optimistic outlook is predicated on AI moving from experimental deployments to measurable productivity gains and revenue generation across enterprise sectors.

Wall Street analysts and institutional investors are displaying near-universal optimism about AI's revolutionary potential, with Fidelity International describing it as "the defining theme for equity markets" in 2026. However, this consensus raises questions about whether expectations have outpaced reality, particularly as companies face pressure to demonstrate ROI on massive AI infrastructure investments.

## GNSS News

CES 2026 showcased the GNSS industry's push toward consumer applications and ruggedized solutions for challenging environments, while geodetic authorities continued rolling out critical reference system updates.

### CHC Navigation Brings Centimeter-Level Positioning to Consumer Lawn Mowers

CHC Navigation (CHCNAV) announced that MOVA has integrated its PointX satellite ground service and StellaX high-precision positioning chip into the NAVAX 5000 AWD intelligent robotic lawn mower, unveiled at CES 2026. The partnership demonstrates how enterprise-grade RTK positioning technology is finally reaching consumer price points and use cases.

What makes this significant is the infrastructure-free approach. Traditional RTK systems require users to install a local base station and maintain cellular data subscriptions—barriers that limited adoption to professional surveying and agriculture. The PointX/StellaX solution achieves centimeter-level accuracy without local base stations, using CHCNAV's satellite-based correction service instead. This "wire-free" positioning model could unlock mass-market applications from robotic lawn care to autonomous delivery vehicles.

The economics are equally important. By eliminating base station hardware and cellular data costs, CHCNAV is making precision positioning viable for products with consumer price sensitivities. If the NAVAX 5000 AWD demonstrates reliable performance, expect similar integrations across other consumer robotics categories throughout 2026.

### ANELLO Photonics Launches Aerial INS for Contested Environments

ANELLO Photonics debuted its Aerial INS (Inertial Navigation System) at CES 2026, combining the company's Silicon Photonics Optical Gyroscope (SiPhOG) technology with integrated multi-band GNSS receivers. The system is purpose-built for demanding aerial platforms including beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) UAS, ISR aircraft, heavy-lift drones, and maritime VTOL operations.

The key performance metric is the Aerial INS's ability to maintain less than 0.5 degrees per hour of unaided heading drift, enabling accurate navigation through GNSS jamming, spoofing, or signal occlusion. As military and commercial drone operations expand into contested environments—whether due to intentional jamming or natural signal blockage in urban canyons—the ability to maintain navigation accuracy without continuous GNSS is becoming mission-critical.

ANELLO's silicon photonics approach offers advantages over traditional fiber-optic gyroscopes: smaller size, lower power consumption, and potentially lower manufacturing costs at scale. If the Aerial INS meets its performance specifications in operational testing, it could become the reference platform for autonomous aerial vehicles operating in GPS-denied environments, from defense applications to commercial drone delivery in dense urban areas.

### National Spatial Reference System Modernization Advances

The National Geodetic Survey (NGS) continues releasing alpha and beta components of the modernized National Spatial Reference System (NSRS), with full replacement anticipated later in 2026. A public meeting originally scheduled for October 2025 but postponed due to the federal government shutdown has been rescheduled for January 21, 2026.

While the official adoption hasn't occurred yet, NGS is encouraging users to begin preparation now. The modernized NSRS will replace NAD 83 and NAVD 88 with a more accurate, globally consistent reference frame that accounts for tectonic plate motion and improves vertical positioning accuracy. The transition affects every organization using survey-grade positioning data—from civil engineering firms to autonomous vehicle developers relying on high-definition maps.

Organizations that delay preparation could face significant disruptions when the official transition occurs. Existing geospatial datasets will require transformation to the new reference frame, and workflows built around NAD 83 coordinates will need updating. The January 21 meeting represents a critical opportunity for stakeholders to understand migration requirements and timelines.
