Every quarter I draft a memo addressed to the next version of our team. It outlines the bets we made, what still feels ambiguous, and the questions I expect to be embarrassed by in six months. The memo is post-dated and stored in a shared archive. When the future eventually arrives, we compare the reality with the intent.

The ritual keeps us honest. We see how our appetite for risk evolved, which narratives aged well, and where we should have invited different voices sooner. It’s a lightweight time capsule that keeps ambition grounded in evidence instead of nostalgia.
