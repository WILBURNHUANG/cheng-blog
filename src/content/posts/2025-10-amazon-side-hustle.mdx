I'm spinning up a tiny internet vending machine a.k.a. an **Amazon affiliate** side hustle. This post is the exact playbook I'm using--**Canada-specific**, current to today--and the handful of creator tips I'm stealing unapologetically.

## Amazon's two flavors: Associates vs. Influencer

- **Amazon Associates (Affiliate Program):** the classic program for bloggers, YouTubers, and social accounts to earn commissions from tracked "Special Links." You recommend stuff + someone buys + you earn a cut.
- **Amazon Influencer Program:** aimed at creators with meaningful social followings. Perks include an Amazon **Storefront** and eligibility to earn from **shoppable videos** and **livestreams** on Amazon.

> TL;DR: If you're just starting a blog/site or YouTube channel, **Associates** is the default. If you already have steady social traction, also try **Influencer**.

## Step-by-step: Sign up on Amazon.ca and make your first links

Everything below is for **Amazon.ca** (Canada). Start here: **[associates.amazon.ca](https://associates.amazon.ca/)**.

![Amazon Associates Canada landing page showing the sign-up buttons](/images/amazon-associates-home.png "Amazon Associates Canada home page")

1. **Create / sign in to your Amazon account**  
   Click **Sign up** and log in with your normal Amazon account. No fees to join.
   ![Amazon sign-in form with email and password fields for the Associates program]
2. **Enter account info**  
   Provide your payee name and address, then list the "**Sites**" where you'll use links (website, YouTube channel, Instagram/TikTok profile URLs, etc.). Use the real places you'll post.
3. **Create your Store ID & profile**  
   Pick a short **Store ID** (shows up in your link tag), choose your content topics, describe how you drive traffic, and complete the quick **phone/PIN** verification.

4. **Tax & payment setup**  
   Add **payment** (e.g., direct deposit) and complete the **tax interview** so Amazon can pay you.
5. **Understand the 180-day checkpoint**  
   You need **at least 3 qualified sales within 180 days** or the application can be closed (you can reapply). Personal orders don't count.
6. **Make your first affiliate links fast with SiteStripe**  
   Once approved/provisioned, enable **SiteStripe** (the slim toolbar at the top of Amazon when you're logged into Associates). Visit any product page and click **Text** (or **Image**) to grab your short link. Paste it into your blog/YouTube description/social landing page.
7. **Post with proper disclosures**  
   Use a clear disclosure like: **"As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases."** For socials, add **(paid link)** or **#ad** near each link. Place disclosures where they're hard to miss.
8. **Know your category rates**  
   Commission rates vary by category and may change. Check the current **Commission Income Statement** in Associates Central (Canada).

> You're live! Next, focus on products your audience actually cares about and create content that helps them decide.

## Affiliate marketing in one minute

**Affiliate marketing** = recommending products with tracked links and earning a commission on **qualifying purchases**. You can do this on:

- **Your blog/website** (guides, comparisons, "best of" lists)  
- **YouTube** (gear lists in descriptions; chapter callouts)  
- **Email newsletters** (confirm your ESP's rules)  
- **Pinterest** (pins that link to your article with affiliate links)  
- **Social** (IG/TikTok; often via a Link-in-bio or a simple landing page)

**Other networks to explore later:** CJ (Commission Junction), Awin, ShareASale, Impact, Rakuten Advertising, eBay Partner Network, Walmart Affiliates, ClickBank, PartnerStack.

## What the successful tutorials emphasize

I pulled notes from popular, current tutorials--especially **Justin Brown (Primal Video)**, who's great at breaking this down--plus Amazon's own docs. The recurring success factors:

1. **Start narrow, not scattered.** Choose 1-2 niches you already talk about.  
2. **Ship helpful content fast.** Publish one comparison ("X vs Y for [use-case]"), one "Best [category] under $X," and one quick setup/FAQ.  
3. **Make linking brain-dead simple.** Use SiteStripe, keep links short, and add the disclosure right beside the link.  
4. **Hit the 3-sale checkpoint early.** Ask friends *to read your content* (not to buy for you), share where relevant, and target easily-needed items (e.g., cables, accessories) your audience already intends to buy.  
5. **Optimize, don't guess.** Check your Associates reports weekly; tweak titles, thumbnails, CTAs, and the order of recommendations.  
6. **Stay compliant.** Clear disclosures, no cloaking, no incentivizing clicks, and follow platform rules (YouTube, Pinterest, email, etc.).

## My minimalist plan for first commissions

- **Pick 1-2 topics I already post about** (no scattershot spamming).  
- **Publish three pieces**: a comparison, a "best of," and a setup/FAQ.  
- **Use SiteStripe short links** + **link-level disclosure** right beside each one.  
- **Review reports weekly** and adjust titles/CTAs and product order.

---

## FAQ (Canada)

- **Is it free to join?** Yes.  
- **Do I need a website?** A site *or* an approved social/app where you'll post links. List the actual places during signup.  
- **How long is review?** You get provisional access; final approval happens after you drive **3 qualified sales within 180 days**.  
- **Where do I see current commission rates?** In Associates Central's **Commission Income Statement** (Canada).

## Wrap-up (and my tiny experiment)

I just kicked this off and I'm treating it like a fun micro-project: build a few useful guides, keep it tidy with disclosures, and see if it buys my coffee habit. If you want to support the journey, I'll drop an **ad block** with a few of my Amazon picks below. Click through if anything looks helpful--**and yes, they're affiliate links**.

Cheers!
