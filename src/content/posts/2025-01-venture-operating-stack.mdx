Founders talk endlessly about capital strategy, yet the real leverage comes from the operating stack that follows. Over the last year I’ve catalogued the go-to tools inside our portfolio: dynamic forecasting linked to bank feeds, procurement bots that negotiate contracts overnight, and async stand-up dashboards that surface blockers without micromanaging.

The through-line is intentional constraint. Every tool must integrate with the data room and produce artifacts investors can audit in real time. That discipline keeps the stack lightweight and prevents the sprawl that sinks young companies before they find product-market fit.
