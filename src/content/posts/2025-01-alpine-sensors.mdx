Avalanche forecasting is now a live collaboration between guides, satellites, and micro-sensors. Our latest alpine pack carries three modules that snap into a single battery backplane: a lidar altimeter for mapping cornices, a snowpack impedance probe, and an ultra-wideband beacon that stitches the readings into a map everyone on the rope team can reference.

The magic isn’t just new data; it’s the cadence. Readings upload over LoRa to a geostationary relay every thirty minutes, then render on a simple phone dashboard. When conditions exceed thresholds, the system blinks a single word: pause. On the skin track, less is more.
