Focus is less about blocking the world and more about building trust with your future self. My current loop has three beats: Monday horizon scans, Wednesday synthesis, Friday retrospectives. Each step is time-boxed to ninety minutes with a hard rule—produce an artifact. It could be a narrative memo, a dashboard refresh, or a list of questions to chase next.

By committing to artifacts, I get to close loops quickly. There’s no gray zone where research lingers and mutates into guilt. The practice also leaves room for serendipity: if something remarkable arrives midweek, it slides into the Wednesday session and becomes next Monday’s horizon.
