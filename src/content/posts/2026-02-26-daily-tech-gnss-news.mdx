Nvidia delivered another blockbuster quarter but investors remained skeptical, sending shares down **5.5%** in the biggest single-day drop since April. The AI chip giant posted record revenue of **$68.1 billion** and guided to **$78 billion** for Q1—yet the market focused on whether the AI boom can sustain such valuations. In GNSS news, Jammertest 2026 opened applications for the world's largest resilience testing event, while GMV Romania demonstrated integrated anti-jamming and anti-spoofing solutions in Black Sea trials.

## Tech News

### Nvidia Beats Estimates But Stock Tumbles on AI Bubble Fears

Nvidia reported fiscal Q4 2026 earnings of **$1.62** per share on revenue of **$68.1 billion**, beating analyst expectations of **$1.54** EPS and **$66.2 billion** revenue. Data center revenue hit a record **$62.3 billion**, up **75%** year-over-year, with networking sales surging **263%** to **$10.98 billion** on strong NVLink adoption.

Despite the beat, shares fell **5.5%** to **$184.89**—the worst single-day decline in 10 months. The company's Q1 fiscal 2027 guidance of **$78 billion** (plus or minus 2%) exceeded Wall Street's **$72.8 billion** estimate, but investors remain nervous about AI spending sustainability. Notably, Nvidia excluded China data center compute revenue from its outlook entirely.

CEO Jensen Huang declared that "the agentic AI inflection point has arrived," highlighting Grace Blackwell with NVLink as delivering "an order-of-magnitude lower cost per token." He previewed Vera Rubin as the next architecture to extend inference leadership, while dismissing the software sector selloff as "illogical."

### Markets Digest Nvidia as Software Bear Market Deepens

The S&P 500 traded flat on Thursday as investors processed Nvidia's mixed signals. The Dow gained **0.21%** while the Nasdaq edged up **0.04%**. Gold retreated **$34** to **$5,173**, while Bitcoin held steady around **$68,100**.

The broader software sector remains under pressure, with the S&P North American Technology Software Index down **32%** from September highs—deep in bear market territory. Fears that AI agents will disrupt traditional software business models continue to weigh on valuations, despite many companies integrating AI capabilities into their products.

AMD saw related strength after Nutanix announced a multiyear partnership with the chipmaker, including a **$250 million** investment. The deal positions AMD to capture more enterprise AI workloads as customers seek alternatives to Nvidia's dominant position.

### Apple Teases Monday Product Launch

Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed the company's latest product rollout begins Monday, with reports suggesting new MacBooks and a lower-cost iPhone are likely among the announcements. The timing follows months of speculation about Apple's AI strategy and whether the company can close the gap with rivals in generative AI capabilities.

### Additional Headlines

- **Memory Shortage to Hit Smartphones Hard**: IDC forecasts the smartphone market will see its largest year-over-year decline ever in 2026, plummeting **13%** to decade lows due to global memory constraints.
- **Nvidia Gross Margins at 75%**: Bloomberg analysis noted the exceptional profitability gives AI rivals "something to aim for" as competition intensifies.
- **Hyperscalers to Spend $650B on AI**: Collective capital expenditure forecasts from major cloud providers represent a **60%** increase from 2025, with Nvidia capturing the lion's share.

## GNSS News

### Jammertest 2026 Opens Applications for World's Largest Resilience Event

Organizers of Jammertest, the world's largest open PNT/GNSS resilience testing event, have opened applications for Jammertest 2026, scheduled for September 14-18 at Andøya, Norway. The application deadline is April 6, 2026.

The annual event provides a unique opportunity to test the robustness of navigation and positioning systems under controlled jamming and spoofing conditions. With GNSS interference incidents increasing globally—particularly in maritime and aviation sectors—the event has grown in strategic importance for manufacturers, integrators, and end users seeking to validate resilient PNT solutions.

Hexagon | NovAtel recently released firmware updates for its OEM7 family specifically targeting reliability in challenging environments, reflecting industry focus on maintaining accuracy under foliage cover and in mixed urban scenarios where signal degradation is common.

### GMV Romania Demonstrates Resilient Maritime PNT in Black Sea

The RIPTIDE Phase 2 project, led by GMV Innovating Solutions Romania with ESA support, has successfully field-tested an integrated "Monitor & Protect" demonstrator in the Black Sea and Lower Danube Basin. The system addresses jamming and spoofing risks affecting ports, shipping lanes, and coastal infrastructure in a region that has seen intensified GNSS interference.

The demonstration comes as Galileo's Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) transitions from experimental status to a fully declared service, confirming Galileo's position as the world's first civilian GNSS to provide cryptographically authenticated navigation data. EUSPA is sponsoring an "OSNMA DAY" event in Torrejon, Spain, to promote adoption of the authentication capability.

Meanwhile, researchers have developed a new GNSS-only positioning method using tightly coupled Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering with robust outlier rejection, achieving stable sub-meter accuracy in dense urban environments without requiring carrier-phase ambiguity resolution—a significant advance for autonomous vehicle applications.

## Key Takeaways

- **Nvidia Results Can't Quell AI Skepticism**: Despite record **$68.1B** revenue and **$78B** guidance beating estimates, the **5.5%** stock drop shows investors questioning whether AI spending growth can justify current valuations.
- **Software Disruption Fears Persist**: The **32%** decline in software stocks since September reflects deep uncertainty about AI's impact on traditional business models, even as Nvidia dismisses concerns as overblown.
- **GNSS Resilience Gains Urgency**: From Jammertest applications to Black Sea anti-spoofing trials, the industry is accelerating investments in protecting navigation systems against the growing threat of intentional interference.
