Nvidia delivered a blockbuster quarter that exceeded Wall Street expectations, posting record **$68.1 billion** revenue as the AI infrastructure boom shows no signs of slowing. But the day's biggest story may be Anthropic's escalating standoff with the Pentagon over AI safety guardrails, with Defense Secretary Hegseth threatening to invoke the Defense Production Act. Meanwhile, Japan's antitrust watchdog raided Microsoft's Tokyo offices over Azure cloud practices. In GNSS news, Topcon and Fixposition announced a collaboration on AI-enabled visual positioning, while EUSPA signed a major contract for the European GNSS Service Demonstrator.

## Tech News

### Nvidia Crushes Q4 Estimates as AI Boom Accelerates

Nvidia reported record fourth-quarter revenue of **$68.1 billion**, up **73%** from a year ago and beating analyst estimates of **$66.2 billion**. Earnings per share came in at **$1.62** adjusted, topping the **$1.53** consensus. The stock rose approximately **2%** in extended trading as the AI chip leader demonstrated continued dominance in the accelerating infrastructure buildout.

The data center segment—now representing over **91%** of total revenue—posted **$62.3 billion** in sales, up **75%** year-over-year and **22%** sequentially. Hyperscalers including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft remained the largest customer category, accounting for just over **50%** of data center revenue. These "Fab Four" cloud giants are projected to spend a combined **$660-690 billion** on capital expenditures in 2026.

Net income nearly doubled to **$43 billion** from **$22.1 billion** in the year-ago quarter. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the Blackwell platform's momentum, noting it delivers up to **50x** better performance and **35x** lower cost for agentic AI compared to Hopper. The company also unveiled the next-generation Rubin platform, comprising six new chips targeting a **10x** reduction in inference token costs—with availability expected in the second half of 2026.

### What Nvidia's Results Mean for the Market

Nvidia's blowout quarter carries significant implications for the broader tech landscape. As the world's most valuable company with a market cap exceeding **$4.7 trillion**, Nvidia's performance serves as a barometer for AI infrastructure spending confidence. The beat-and-raise results suggest hyperscaler demand remains "insatiable," as Wedbush Securities described it.

However, questions persist about sustainability. Analysts note that Google's Trillium, AWS's Trainium, and Microsoft's Maia custom chips are maturing—every dollar hyperscalers spend on proprietary silicon is a dollar not spent on Nvidia. The transition from training to inference workloads also changes the competitive dynamics, as inference represents a larger opportunity but with different hardware requirements.

The Rubin platform announcement, alongside the new Rubin CPX chips designed for massive-context inference, positions Nvidia to capture the agentic AI wave. CEO Huang projected **$500 billion** in combined GPU sales between Blackwell and Rubin generations, with AI labs including Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, and xAI already committed to the new platform.

### Anthropic Faces Pentagon Ultimatum Over AI Safety

Anthropic, the AI safety-focused startup behind Claude, faces a Friday deadline from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to remove guardrails from its AI systems or risk severe consequences. The Pentagon has threatened to invoke the Defense Production Act to compel Anthropic's cooperation and label the company a "supply chain risk"—effectively blacklisting it from government contracts.

At issue are two non-negotiable positions Anthropic has maintained: prohibitions on AI-controlled autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance of American citizens. CEO Dario Amodei reiterated these "red lines" in a meeting with Hegseth, and sources indicate the company has no plans to budge despite the **$200 million** Pentagon contract at stake.

Separately, Anthropic announced changes to its Responsible Scaling Policy on Tuesday, replacing self-imposed guardrails with a more flexible safety framework. The company said the two-year-old policy's requirement to pause training if capabilities outstripped safety controls could hinder its ability to compete. Anthropic emphasized the policy change is unrelated to the Pentagon dispute, but critics noted the timing amid the heated standoff.

### Japan Raids Microsoft Over Azure Antitrust Concerns

Japan's Fair Trade Commission conducted an on-site inspection of Microsoft Japan's Tokyo offices on Tuesday, investigating whether the company violated antitrust law through restrictive Azure cloud practices. The probe focuses on allegations that Microsoft made software services including Microsoft 365—which includes Teams and Word—inaccessible or more expensive on competing clouds like AWS and Google Cloud.

The investigation mirrors similar regulatory scrutiny in Europe, the United States, United Kingdom, and Brazil over Microsoft's cloud bundling practices. If regulators find a breach of antimonopoly law, Microsoft could face fines or orders to change its business practices in Japan. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the company is "fully cooperating with the JFTC."

The raid echoes an earlier antitrust action against Microsoft Japan in the early 2000s over restrictive licensing. Cloud competition remains fierce, with Microsoft Azure holding approximately **25%** global market share behind AWS's **30%**.

## GNSS News

### Topcon and Fixposition Partner on Visual-Aided GNSS

Topcon Positioning Systems and Fixposition announced a collaboration agreement at Geo Week 2026 in Denver to develop integrated positioning technology for future products. The partnership combines Topcon's high-precision GNSS expertise with Fixposition's pioneering Visual RTK and AI-enabled multi-modality fusion positioning.

"We see this AI-enabled technology as an innovative integration with our next-generation GNSS solutions," said Ron Oberlander, head of the Topcon Geomatics Platform. Fixposition's xFusion technology uses visual data to enhance GNSS positioning in challenging environments where satellite signals alone prove insufficient.

The announcement came alongside Topcon's introduction of the CR-S1 handheld scanning system, which combines LiDAR, panoramic cameras, visual SLAM cameras, and a GNSS antenna in a single device. The system targets surveying and construction professionals with applications in land surveying, tunnel mapping, forestry analysis, mining, utility mapping, and power line inspection.

### EUSPA Awards Thales Contract for European GNSS Demonstrator

The European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) signed a Framework Contract with Thales Alenia Space to build the European GNSS Service Demonstrator (ESD)—a centralized modular platform designed to advance EU Space services including EGNOS, Galileo, Copernicus, and GOVSATCOM/IRIS2.

The ESD will comprise modular ground and support segments capable of handling diverse Reference Stations and data, computing corrections and messages for real-time dissemination via GEO satellite and internet. The platform represents a significant step toward modernizing Europe's navigation infrastructure.

Meanwhile, GPS World reports that testing in challenging urban environments—including Frankfurt's glass corridors and Tokyo's Shinjuku district—demonstrates that automotive safety depends more on GNSS reliability when signals are distorted than peak accuracy under ideal conditions. This research underscores the importance of robust positioning as Level 3 autonomy deployments expand globally.
