Reusable landers and lunar communication relays are inspiring a new kind of freight problem. The orbits between low Earth orbit and the Moon now resemble busy shipping lanes, each with burn windows, propellant depots, and handoff points. Our team has been prototyping software that treats maneuvers like intermodal routes—complete with delay buffers and risk scoring.

The software ingests telemetry from partner satellites, maps it against predicted space weather, and produces a manifest that includes delta-v budgets, payload constraints, and contingency plans. Once a mission is in flight, the system re-optimizes every time a maneuver reports deviation. It’s dispatch for the dark.
