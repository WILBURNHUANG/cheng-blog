Community microgrids used to be grant-funded science projects. Now they’re cash-flowing assets thanks to demand response markets. We’re seeing the emergence of funds that bundle grid credits from dozens of neighborhoods, securitize the payouts, and offer investors exposure to resilience-as-a-service.

The mechanics are elegant: households opt in, the fund installs storage and control software, and the grid operator pays for capacity during peak events. Investors get quarterly distributions, residents enjoy lower bills, and the grid becomes harder to knock offline. Finance can be beautiful when incentives align.
