The AI infrastructure race continues to reshape both the tech and positioning industries as 2026 gets underway. Asian tech stocks are leading global markets with AI chip IPOs, while the GNSS sector sees new products targeting GPS-denied environments for autonomous systems. Here's what's moving markets today.

## Tech News

### Data Center Investment to Hit $3 Trillion by 2030

A new industry assessment projects that data centers will require approximately **$3 trillion in investment through 2030**, covering servers, specialized compute gear, facilities, and critically—new power capacity. This staggering figure underscores how AI infrastructure has become the new competitive battleground.

The investment thesis is no longer just about who has the best models. As Wedbush's Dan Ives put it, "It's a prove it year" for AI and tech. The bottleneck has shifted from algorithmic innovation to raw compute and power availability. Companies that can secure reliable energy sources and build out physical infrastructure will have decisive advantages.

BE Semiconductor Industries is already drawing takeover interest as specialized packaging technologies become strategic assets in the AI accelerator supply chain.

### Asia Tech Stocks Surge on AI Momentum

Asia's technology stocks have charged into 2026 with investors betting their outperformance against US peers will continue. Goldman Sachs strategists are overweight on the sector, citing surging AI-related demand and reasonable valuations.

The standout story is Shanghai Biren Technology's Hong Kong debut—shares jumped nearly **76%** on the first trading day, marking the best IPO performance since early 2021 for listings raising at least $700 million. The AI chip designer raised $717 million with retail subscriptions over 2,300 times oversubscribed.

Meanwhile, Baidu's AI chip unit Kunlunxin has confidentially filed for its own Hong Kong IPO, signaling a busy year ahead for Chinese tech listings despite geopolitical headwinds.

### Sovereign Wealth Funds Pour $15 Billion into AI

Global sovereign wealth funds have amassed a record **$15 trillion** in assets under management, and they're increasingly betting on technology. These state-backed investors deployed roughly $15 billion into AI-related investments in 2025 alone.

Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds are leading the charge on digital investments, with Abu Dhabi's Mubadala, Kuwait Investment Authority, and Qatar Investment Authority among the most active. This capital injection provides patient, long-term funding for AI infrastructure buildouts that may take years to generate returns.

## GNSS News

### ANELLO Photonics Launches Aerial INS for GPS-Denied Operations

At CES 2026, ANELLO Photonics unveiled the **Aerial INS**—a compact inertial navigation system built around their Silicon Photonics Optical Gyroscope (SiPhOG) technology with integrated multi-band GNSS receivers.

The system targets demanding aerial platforms including BVLOS drones, maritime VTOL systems, ISR aircraft, and heavy-lift cargo drones. Key specs include heading drift of less than 0.5 degrees per hour and over 98% navigation accuracy without cameras or fiber-optic cables. The dual triple-frequency all-constellation GNSS receivers support RTK/PPP corrections.

What makes this significant is the contested environment capability. The Aerial INS maintains navigation during GNSS jamming, spoofing, or complete signal loss—critical for defense applications and increasingly relevant for commercial operations in congested urban environments. Evaluation units are available now with production shipments beginning Q2 2026.

### GPS World's 2026 Focus: Autonomy and Precision Agriculture

GPS World has outlined its editorial priorities for 2026, with cover stories tackling **transportation, defense, autonomous systems, precision agriculture**, and complementary PNT (positioning, navigation, timing) technologies.

The convergence of satellite-based sensors, UAVs, ground sensors, and GNSS corrections has made agriculture one of the largest GNSS user segments. Autonomous tractors, sprayers, and combines face far fewer safety concerns than vehicles on public roads—no traffic, accidents, or construction to navigate—making them ideal proving grounds for autonomous technology.

ComNav's AG502 autosteer system exemplifies the trend, integrating satellite reception, positioning, navigation, and autonomous driving into a single package. Modern farm machinery also incorporates inertial navigation for GNSS outages and lidar/radar/vision systems for obstacle avoidance.

## Key Takeaways

- **Infrastructure is king**: The $3 trillion data center investment projection and semiconductor M&A activity confirm that AI competition has shifted from models to physical infrastructure and power access.
- **GPS-denied navigation is production-ready**: ANELLO's Aerial INS launch signals that commercial-grade inertial navigation for contested environments is moving from R&D to deployment.
- **Precision agriculture leads autonomous adoption**: With fewer safety constraints than public roads, farming continues to serve as the primary commercial proving ground for autonomous GNSS applications.
