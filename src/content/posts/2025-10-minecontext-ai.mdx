If you’ve ever closed 27 tabs and immediately forgotten what problem you were solving, **MineContext** is the “external brain” you wish you had. It’s a proactive, context-aware desktop agent from ByteDance’s Volcengine team that quietly captures your on-screen work (screenshots + text understanding), organizes it, and then **pushes** you summaries, to-dos, prompts, and resurfaced references when they’re actually useful. Think “Spotlight search + personal historian + gentle project manager.”

## What MineContext is (in one breath)

An **open-source**, local-first app (currently with a Mac download) that records your digital activity via screen monitoring, runs a processing pipeline (chunking, entity extraction, dedupe, embeddings), stores it in a local DB (SQLite/Chroma), and lets an LLM/VLM answer questions or proactively generate daily/weekly briefings, to-dos, and writing prompts from your **real** context. You bring your own API key (OpenAI or ByteDance’s Doubao, with Ollama planned).

### Why that matters

- **Local-first privacy.** Your captured context stays on device by design. For anything “lifeloggy,” that’s huge.  
- **Proactive, not just reactive.** It doesn’t wait for your perfect prompt; it nudges you with summaries and next steps.  
- **Built like a platform.** There’s a modular backend (FastAPI + managers for capture/processing/consumption) and a roadmap of context sources (files, MCP-enabled apps like Notion/Jira/Figma, RSS, email, even wearables).

## How it works under the hood (nerd-friendly)

**Capture → Process → Store → Resurface/Generate**

1. **Capture:** Periodic screenshots + (soon) files, links, meeting notes, browser extensions, MCP app data.  
2. **Process:** Chunking, entity extraction/normalization, multi-modal understanding, and embedding.  
3. **Store:** Local vector + relational storage (SQLite/Chroma) for fast similarity search.  
4. **Consume:**  
   - **Q&A** over your day (“find that plot I made at 2:14 pm”).  
   - **Proactive** daily/weekly summaries, to-do suggestions, and “you were working on…” nudges.

> Today, the GUI download is for **macOS**; the backend is cross-plat Python (so Windows/Linux hackers can run services), but the polished desktop app target is Mac right now.

## Concrete use cases I’m excited about

### 1) Writing & research (a.k.a. my life)
- Auto-build a **literature trail**: papers, highlights, code snippets, screenshots of plots—then ask, _“pull the three charts I used to argue X.”_  
- Draft posts from your **actual** working context instead of a blank page.

### 2) Project management without project managing
- It recognizes you bounced between a Jira ticket, a Figma spec, and a PR, then proposes a **bullet update** and a **next-step checklist**.  
- Weekly digest you can paste into a stand-up doc, no spelunking required.

### 3) Meeting memory
- Capture slides and chat windows across calls; generate action items and a recap tied to **screens you actually saw**. (Roadmap includes meeting notes + MCP).

### 4) “Where did I see that?” recovery
- Query by **visual memory**: _“find the blue chart with CN0 on the y-axis I looked at after lunch.”_ The combo of screenshots + embeddings shines here.

## How this could change the way we work

**From “pull” to “push.”** Most tools wait for your query. MineContext flips it: your workspace is passively indexed, and the system **brings back** relevant fragments when you resume a task. It’s the difference between rummaging and being handed the right tray.

**From apps to contexts.** The unit of work stops being “a file in App X.” It becomes **a living context** spanning docs, screenshots, chats, and tasks—resurfaced at the right time. That aligns with the wider shift toward **agentic workflows** where long-context models and MCP-style connectors orchestrate across tools.

**From knowledge hoarding to knowledge circulation.** Daily summaries + nudges reduce decay. Less “what was I doing?” and more “pick up where you left off.”

## The ADHD angle: externalizing executive function

ADHD often challenges **working memory, time management, and task switching**—the executive-function layer that coordinates everything. External aids and structured cues measurably help.

Here’s how MineContext can help, practically:

- **Automatic thought capture.** No friction to “brain-dump.” Screens become recallable context; you ask later, _“what did I do in that 45-minute hyperfocus sprint?”_  
- **Context-aware nudges.** Proactive to-dos and summaries create the **external cues** ADHD brains benefit from—timely prompts that reduce decision fatigue.  
- **Reduce context switching tax.** When you must switch, the agent preserves state and **reconstructs** it later—less re-onboarding each time.  
- **Ritualize progress with weekly retros.** Scheduled digests provide a body-double-ish accountability effect (“here’s what you shipped”), which the ADHD community often finds motivating.

**Tip-sheet for ADHD-friendly setup (my picks):**
1. **Short capture interval** (e.g., 5–10s) for finer recall without manual notes.  
2. **Daily + weekly briefs** turned on; pipe the output into your task app.  
3. Create a **“Restart Me” prompt** the agent pins whenever you reopen a project: _“Yesterday you touched A/B/C; next best action is D.”_  
4. Pair it with a lightweight **body-doubling** session (Focusmate/FlowClub, or even a friend on video). Start the timer; let MineContext prep your kickoff checklist.

## Privacy, ethics, and the “always watching” feeling

Lifelogging raises real privacy questions. MineContext’s **local-first** posture is a strong start, but you should still:  
- Define capture areas (not the whole screen).  
- Exclude personal windows (banking, 2FA).  
- Periodically purge + encrypt backups.  
The broader HCI literature flags privacy trade-offs in visual lifelogging; design your setup with that in mind.

---

## Limitations today

- **Mac-first experience.** Windows/Linux require tinkering with the backend; polished desktop builds aren’t the primary path (yet).  
- **APIs & models.** You’ll need your own LLM key (OpenAI/Doubao). Local models are on the roadmap, but quality/cost trade-offs apply.  
- **Over-capture temptation.** More data ≠ more clarity. Curate sources, or you’ll drown in screenshots. (Ask me how I know.)

---

## Getting started (what I did)

1. Grab the **Mac app** from the repo’s release page.  
2. Run the quarantine command the README suggests (macOS thing).  
3. Drop in your API key.  
4. Turn on **Screen Monitor**, pick a capture region, and… forget about it for a day. Let the agent surprise you with its first daily brief.

---

## Bottom line

MineContext makes a persuasive case that the future of work isn’t five more apps—it’s a **thin, local layer** that continuously understands your context and helps you resume, recall, and ship. If your brain runs a little spicy (mine does), those timely nudges and “here’s-what-you-were-doing” breadcrumbs feel less like surveillance and more like **kind structure**.
