Heat shield design is moving from ablative tiles to woven composites that can redirect energy instead of absorbing it. We’ve been experimenting with lattices that change conductivity mid-flight. A mesh of carbon and basalt fibers is threaded with shape-memory alloys that tighten at specific temperatures, effectively opening and closing radiative vents.

When paired with real-time telemetry, the shield becomes a dynamic surface. The onboard computer predicts hotspots, triggers micro-adjustments, and the weaving behaves like a living fabric. It’s lighter, re-usable, and far more forgiving when a mission profile shifts mid-course.
