Guiding on glaciated terrain after dark used to be an act of faith. Now we launch a palm-sized thermal drone that sweeps the route ahead and projects a simple overlay into our visors: crevasse edges glow amber, safe bridges glow cobalt. The drone flies a daisy-chain pattern, updating the map with each lap while conserving battery.

The system is tuned for quiet. Prop noise stays below the level of a whisper and the display uses soft gradients instead of glaring floodlights. It feels less like piloting a robot and more like being handed a sixth sense when the weather closes in.
