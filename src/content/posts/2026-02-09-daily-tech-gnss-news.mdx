Corporate debt markets and regulatory action took center stage as Alphabet launched a historic **$20 billion** bond sale—including the first 100-year technology bond since the dot-com era—while the European Commission formally charged Meta with antitrust violations over WhatsApp's AI exclusivity. In positioning news, Furuno signed a partnership with Xona Space Systems to integrate LEO PNT into timing products, and SpaceX pitched Starlink as a GPS alternative to the FCC.

## Tech News

### Alphabet Launches Record $20 Billion Bond Sale With Rare 100-Year Offering

Alphabet is embarking on the largest debt issuance in its history, raising **$20 billion** in U.S. dollar bonds—surpassing the initial **$15 billion** target after orders exceeded **$100 billion**. The Google parent is simultaneously preparing a landmark sterling offering that includes a 100-year bond, marking the first century debt from a technology company since the late 1990s.

The multi-currency borrowing spree spans dollar, sterling, and Swiss franc tranches, with the century bond expected to price as early as Monday. The fundraising directly supports Alphabet's announcement last week of up to **$185 billion** in capital expenditures for 2026—more than the company spent in the previous three years combined—as it races to build AI data center infrastructure.

Investor Michael Burry warned the 100-year bond "mirrors Motorola in 1997," the last time a tech company issued century debt—and the final year Motorola was considered an industry leader. Analysts counter that Alphabet's move signals confidence in its balance sheet strength and diversifies funding sources for its unprecedented AI infrastructure buildout.

### EU Charges Meta With Antitrust Violations Over WhatsApp AI Block

The European Commission issued a formal statement of objections to Meta, alleging the company breached EU antitrust rules by blocking third-party AI assistants from WhatsApp. Competition Commissioner Teresa Ribera announced the bloc is "considering interim measures" to force Meta to restore competitor access while the investigation continues.

Meta updated its WhatsApp Business terms in October 2025 to ban third-party AI assistants, with the policy taking effect January 15, 2026. The change blocks competitors including ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI services from connecting to WhatsApp's approximately **3 billion** users worldwide, leaving Meta AI as the sole option on the platform.

Meta labeled the allegations "baseless" and cited "unsustainable strain" on WhatsApp systems. Italy and Brazil have already ordered Meta to suspend the policy within their territories. If found in violation, Meta faces fines of up to **10%** of global annual revenue—potentially exceeding **$15 billion** based on 2025 figures.

### YouTube TV Unveils $65 Sports Package in Major Streaming Pivot

YouTube announced the launch of lower-priced YouTube TV plans, headlined by a **$64.99/month** Sports Plan that undercuts the main **$82.99** package by **$18**. The move represents Google's most significant streaming restructure since YouTube TV launched nearly a decade ago.

The Sports Plan includes all major broadcast networks plus ESPN, FS1, NFL Network, and regional sports networks, with ESPN Unlimited access coming this fall. Other new options include Sports + News at **$71.99**, Entertainment at **$54.99**, and News + Entertainment + Family at **$69.99**. New subscribers receive first-year promotional pricing—the Sports Plan drops to **$54.99/month**.

More than **10 different plans** will be available, all priced below the full YouTube TV package. Subscribers retain core features including unlimited DVR, six-member family sharing, and multiview. The timing coincides with a packed sports calendar featuring the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics, and NBA All-Star Weekend.

### Additional Headlines

- **ServiceNow Acquires Armis for $7.75B**: The all-cash deal, ServiceNow's largest acquisition ever, adds cyber exposure and OT security capabilities. Armis abandoned IPO plans for the buyout weeks after raising **$435 million** in a pre-IPO round.
- **Anthropic's $20B Round Closing This Week**: The AI company's funding round, backed by Nvidia, Microsoft, and top VCs, will close as soon as next week at a **$350 billion** valuation—five months after raising **$13 billion**.
- **CIA Accelerates Tech Access**: The Central Intelligence Agency announced initiatives to speed adoption of breakthrough technologies as it races to compete with China.
- **Apple's February Product Blitz**: Apple is expected to announce iPhone 17e on February 19, maintaining the **$599** price point. New iPads with A18/M4 chips and Mac updates are set for early March.

## GNSS News

### Furuno and Xona Partner to Bring LEO PNT to Timing Applications

Japanese electronics manufacturer Furuno Electric has signed a memorandum of understanding with Xona Space Systems to integrate Xona's Pulsar LEO positioning, navigation, and timing service into next-generation products. The partnership, announced February 3, prioritizes timing and synchronization applications for critical infrastructure.

Xona's Pulsar system uses a dedicated constellation of **258 satellites** in low Earth orbit, delivering signals approximately **100 times stronger** than legacy GPS. The proximity of LEO satellites enables centimeter-level accuracy, signal authentication, and reliable navigation in challenging environments including urban canyons, forests, and areas subject to interference or jamming.

Furuno's Pulsar-enabled solutions will maintain accurate synchronization even when GNSS is degraded by jamming or spoofing. Timing for critical infrastructure represents the initial operational use case, with full position and velocity integration following as receiver designs mature. Xona expects initial satellite launches in late 2026, with service beginning in 2027.

### SpaceX Pitches Starlink as GPS Alternative in FCC Filing

SpaceX submitted detailed comments to the Federal Communications Commission outlining Starlink's existing and potential positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities. The filing responds to the FCC's Notice of Inquiry on promoting resilient PNT alternatives to GPS.

According to SpaceX, Starlink terminals currently provide **nanosecond-level timing accuracy** and **meter-level positioning** using time-of-arrival measurements from the satellite constellation. The company emphasized that its network supports precise timing applications—including cellular network synchronization—without external GPS sources.

SpaceX highlighted Starlink's security advantages: LEO configuration with thousands of satellites, directional phased-array antennas for interference mitigation, and end-to-end encryption resistant to spoofing. However, Professor Todd Humphreys of the University of Texas cautioned that "Starlink's timing in the Ku band is so irregular that accurate pseudorange-based PNT is not possible" at present. SpaceX also noted plans to integrate PNT into its cellular Starlink service launching with T-Mobile in July.
