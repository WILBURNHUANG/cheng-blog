> 🧑‍🚀 **Seasoned astronaut?** Delete this file. Have fun!

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

## 🔄 Rename the Vercel Project to "TechNTrek"

Follow these steps to update the autogenerated Vercel domain to match a new project name:

1. Log into [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and open the **Projects** tab.
2. Select your blog project from the list to open its dashboard.
3. Navigate to **Settings → General** in the left sidebar.
4. In the **Project Name** field, replace the existing name with `TechNTrek` and click **Save**.
5. Confirm the prompt—Vercel will trigger a redeploy so the new `techntrek.vercel.app` domain becomes active.
6. Once the deployment finishes, visit `https://techntrek.vercel.app` (or your custom domain) to verify everything loads correctly.
